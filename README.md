Distributed browser based shared tabletop.

Very early code.  You probably don't want to use it.

1. Clone heron into ../heron
2. Run rake to fetch most dependencies and compile code.
3. Download ExtJS 4+ and unzip into public/external.
4. Copy ext-all.js, ext-all-dev.js, and bootstrap.js to public/external.
5. Optionally delete the extjs folder, though might want to keep it for the docs.
